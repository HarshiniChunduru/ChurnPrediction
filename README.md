# ChurnPrediction
Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that can predict customer churn based on behavioral, transactional, and demographic data. The goal is to identify customers likely to discontinue a service and generate actionable business insights.
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing/null values to ensure data quality.
Encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scaled numerical features to normalize values for better model performance.
Model Building:
Applied supervised learning algorithms such as XGBoost for churn classification.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and confusion matrix to ensure robust performance.
Output Generation:
Generated a final CSV file containing churn predictions for provided test data.
